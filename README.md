## hi omg hiiii 

My name is Miłosz <sub><sup>(pronounced /ˈmi.wɔʂ/ or *ME-wash*; easy to remember as a personal hygiene joke)</sup></sub>

Currently employed by [**Reversec**](https://reversec.com/) (formerly WithSecure Consulting), where I primarily look after:
* Our mobile security service area
* The summer internship program in the UK
* UK university/student outreach

In my previous life, I was a teaching assistant at the **University of Southampton**; I still occasionally pick up odd jobs there.

## current projects
* I'm one of the maintainers of the recently-revived [drozer](https://labs.withsecure.com/tools/drozer) &mdash; a popular Android security tool. The [drozer console](https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/drozer) and [Android agent](https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/drozer-agent) can be found here on GitHub
* I'm also working on several applications replicating vulnerabilities we've seen in the wild in iOS and Android apps
